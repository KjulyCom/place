Have an appointment with a future colleague (may be) at Xi'an, Shaanxi.  

After that, one of my highschool classmates took me to visit the ancient city, she's familar here cause she studies here for several years. But to be honest, I don't really like this city. Maybe it's just because of having seen a lot of amazing architecture and landscapes on the way to Tibet. Aesthetic fatigue? May be.
